# Schelling_Segregation_Hooda_Sana

Schelling's work shows that persons with "moderate" in-group preferences for their own group can still lead to de facto segregation, resulting in a highly segregated society ( racial segregation).

The model was introduced by Thomas Schelling in 1971, to illustrate how individual incentives and individual perceptions of difference can lead collectively to segregation.

The original model of Schelling (1971) is set in a NxN grid. Agents are split into two groups and occupy spaces of the grid and only one agent can occupy a space at a time Agents desire a fraction of their neighborhood to be from the same group (Ba). B being current outsiders in the neighbourhood, If B < Ba , then, the agent will choose to relocate to a vacant spot where B >/ Ba. This continues until every agent is satisfied (happy). 

In this code we present a 100x100 world with one agent occupying one space. Every agent starts with a random space.
